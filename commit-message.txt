"feat: Implement Cropper.js modal with dynamic preview and input sync

- Integrated Cropper.js via CDN to allow cropping/resizing before upload
- Added a responsive and accessible cropper modal in create-post-modal.php
- Enabled cropping from drag-drop image input with preview logic
- Dynamically created new File objects from cropped canvas blobs
- Appended cropped files to a synced <input type='file' multiple> using DataTransfer API
- Maintained visual previews using Tailwind utility classes and fade-in animation
- Integrated remove button for each preview with proper file list sync
- Ensured all cropped images are submitted with form without breaking existing modal UI
- Preserved all previous file input and image validation functionality (max 5 images, 3MB each)
- Separated logic cleanly in image-upload.js for reusability and future modularity

ðŸŽ¯ This update prepares the post creation module for professional-level image handling workflows, enabling advanced UX like cropping and inline preview control.
