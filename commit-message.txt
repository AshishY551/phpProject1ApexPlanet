✅`feat: Add advanced login page UI (fully responsive + animations)`

 🎯 Summary:

Implemented a highly polished, future-ready login interface at `/views/auth/login.php` built to meet industry-level UI/UX and scalability standards.

 🔧 Key Features:

* **Advanced UI Design** using TailwindCSS v2 with smooth `animate-fadeIn` effects.
* **Fully Responsive Layout** (mobile → desktop) for high-end client readiness.
* **Dark Mode Support** with contrast-optimized input fields and labels.
* **User-friendly Inputs** with consistent spacing, border styles, hover, and focus interactions.
* **"Remember Me" & "Forgot Password" UI** for full-feature auth flow.
* **Call-to-action link** to `/views/auth/signup.php` for registration redirect.
* **Modular file separation**: CSS → `/public/assets/css/authentication/auth.css`, JS → `/public/assets/js/authentication/auth.js`.

 💡 Technologies Used:

* TailwindCSS (CDN, utility-first responsive design)
* HTML5 Semantic Markup
* Progressive enhancement via dark mode classes
* Custom CSS and JS for authentication logic (deferred for performance)

 🔐 Security Prep:

* All fields properly `required`, email validated
* JS file (`auth.js`) pre-linked for future integration of:

  * AJAX login
  * Token-based session
  * CSRF protection (future enhancement)

 📈 Future-Ready Additions (UI already supports):

* 🔄 Password reset modal
* 📲 2FA/MFA step (email or OTP)
* ⛔ Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
* 🔐 Social login buttons (Google/GitHub)
* 🧠 Error feedback and server-side validation display (to be integrated in backend)
