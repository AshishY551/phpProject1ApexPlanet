feat: Implemented Advanced Create Post Functionality (Page + Modal)

🎯 Key Features:
- Added full `add-post.php` page for creating new posts
- Integrated secure, animated modal form `create-post-modal.php` for instant post creation
- Included responsive dual buttons: (1) open modal, (2) go to full create page

🛡️ Security:
- CSRF protection using `$_SESSION['csrf_token']`
- File upload validation and safe storage to `public/uploads/posts/`
- Required field validation (title, description, category)

💅 UI/UX:
- Tailwind CSS-based responsive design
- Category + status selectors (future dynamic-ready)
- Modern animated buttons with hover, pulse, and transitions
- Fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop

🧠 Backend Ready:
- Form action wired to `/modules/posts/create.php`
- Backend logic ready for DB insert, slug generation, image handling
- Clean separation of modal vs full page creation

🧩 Modular & Scalable:
- Modal kept in `sections/modals/create-post-modal.php`
- Page in `views/add-post.php`
- Future AJAX/inline support possible without major rewrite

📦 Assets:
- JS handlers added in `public/assets/js/components/create-post.js`
- Animation & form styling added in scoped modular CSS if needed

This commit completes the Create (C in CRUD) feature with both modern UI/UX and scalable backend-ready architecture.
