🔐 Setup: Advanced Auth Module – Folder Structure Finalized, Register Logic Added

✅ Auth System Directory Structure Finalized:
- /views/auth/ → Contains signup.php, login.php (UI pages), future pages (verify.php, forgot.php, reset.php)
- /sections/modals/ → Includes signup-modal.php & login-modal.php (modal versions of forms)
- /modules/users/ → Added register.php for signup POST handling (secure, scalable)
- /public/assets/js/authentication/ → Created auth.js for interactive form handling
- /public/assets/css/authentication/ → Added auth.css for custom auth styles
- /public/assets/images/oauth/ → Added SVG icons for OAuth placeholders (Google, Facebook, GitHub, Passkey)

📦 DB & Backend:
- Added secure `register.php` using:
  • Bcrypt for password hashing
  • Email and password validation
  • Duplicate email check
  • Unique slug generation using helper
  • JSON-based response system
- Input field mapped from `fullname` → to `username` for consistency with DB
- Used `generateUniqueSlug($pdo, $username, 'users')` for unique profile slugs

🗃️ Database Schema Updates:
- Added `slug VARCHAR(100)` column to `users` table
- Added `UNIQUE(slug)` constraint for uniqueness
- Cleaned up duplicate index (slug_2) from users table

🎨 UI Enhancements:
- Updated `<input name="fullname">` in signup.php to align with backend slug generation
- Added animated "OR" divider and OAuth login placeholders
- Improved signup & login page backgrounds for more attractive professional-grade UI
- All inputs use animated Tailwind transitions, dark mode support, and validation-ready design

📁 Status:
✅ Folder structure is now scalable, industry-standard, and future-ready
✅ Register functionality secure and working
✅ Database ready for all auth features (slug, username, role-based auth, etc.)

🧱 Ready for:
🔜 login.php backend
🔜 CSRF token integration
🔜 Email verification & 2FA extension (already designed for future)
