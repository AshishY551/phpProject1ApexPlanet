‚ú®‚úÖSignup Page Fully Working
‚ú® Implemented and finalized AJAX-based user signup flow with full frontend/backend integration

‚úÖ Signup UI (views/auth/signup.php):
   ‚Ä¢ Fully responsive, animated form using Tailwind CSS
   ‚Ä¢ Includes username, email, password & confirm password
   ‚Ä¢ Terms checkbox & OAuth buttons for future integrations
   ‚Ä¢ Toast success/error message UI (animated, styled)
   ‚Ä¢ Linked to login page for easy navigation

‚úÖ JS Logic (auth.js):
   ‚Ä¢ Used modern Fetch API with async/await (no reload)
   ‚Ä¢ Handles submit button disabling, loading state, reset
   ‚Ä¢ Dynamic success/error messages via reusable showToast()
   ‚Ä¢ Added redirect to login page upon successful signup
   ‚Ä¢ Debug logs & structured error handling for development

‚úÖ Backend Processing (modules/users/register.php):
   ‚Ä¢ Validates user input (lengths, format, match)
   ‚Ä¢ Checks for existing users (email conflict)
   ‚Ä¢ Hashes password securely using bcrypt (PASSWORD_BCRYPT)
   ‚Ä¢ Generates unique username slug for future use
   ‚Ä¢ Inserts into `users` table with prepared statements (PDO)
   ‚Ä¢ Returns clean JSON response (Content-Type: application/json)
   ‚Ä¢ Added protection against JSON parsing failures (error_reporting + no HTML output)

‚úÖ Auth CSS (auth.css):
   ‚Ä¢ Added reusable fadeIn animation
   ‚Ä¢ Applies to modal popup, success box

üõ†Ô∏è Fixes & Issues:
   ‚Ä¢ Fixed missing auth.js reference by injecting script in footer/layout
   ‚Ä¢ Solved issue: form was submitting but showed ‚ùå Network Error (root cause: invalid JSON response from PHP)
   ‚Ä¢ Solved button stuck on "Registering..." (now resets properly)
   ‚Ä¢ Handled duplicate user edge case with inline toast
   ‚Ä¢ Debug output included to console for easier testing

üß† Architecture Notes:
   ‚Ä¢ No full page reload (modern UX)
   ‚Ä¢ Form works both inside standalone page and modal
   ‚Ä¢ Modular structure aligned with project constraints (advanced, scalable, secure)

üì¶ Files Added/Modified:
   ‚Ä¢ views/auth/signup.php
   ‚Ä¢ public/assets/js/authentication/auth.js
   ‚Ä¢ public/assets/css/authentication/auth.css
   ‚Ä¢ modules/users/register.php
   ‚Ä¢ sections/modals/signup-modal.php (used same backend logic)

üîÆ Future:
   ‚Ä¢ OAuth buttons included (Google, FB, GitHub, Passkey)
   ‚Ä¢ CSRF support can be added via includes/csrf.php
   ‚Ä¢ Email verification (verify.php) and error logging planned
