✨🔧 Finalized Fully Working Signup Modal with Toasts, Duplicate Protection, and Auto-Close

✅ Features Implemented:
- Modal-based signup form (signupFormModal) with full AJAX handling
- Clean toast notifications for success/failure
- Form reset + auto-close modal after success
- Session-based notice banner for first-time user engagement
- Delayed toast visibility before redirect (1.5s)
- Works independently of standard signup page

🔒 Backend Enhancements (/modules/users/register.php):
- Validation for username, email format, password length, match
- Duplicate email and username checks BEFORE insert
- Secure password hashing using BCRYPT
- Slug generation via generateUniqueSlug()
- JSON response for AJAX frontend

🛠️ JavaScript Enhancements:
- Separated modal-specific logic in auth-notice.js
- Introduced `dataset.listenerAttached` guard to prevent double event binding
- Layout now conditionally loads `auth.js` only on signup page and `auth-notice.js` only on index
- Proper toast positioning and visibility now ensured (conflict-free)

🐞 Debug Fixes:
- ✅ Toast messages were not showing — fixed by avoiding double inclusion of `auth.js` and ensuring DOM loads correctly
- ✅ Prevented duplicate AJAX submissions causing skipped user IDs
- ✅ Server error for duplicate usernames now properly handled with a friendly message
- ✅ Verified no double record insertions
- ✅ Correct modal fade-out and hide behavior post-signup

🧪 Final Testing:
- ✅ Signup from dedicated page works and redirects with success toast
- ✅ Modal signup works smoothly and closes with success message
- ✅ Duplicate usernames/emails handled with appropriate feedback
- ✅ DB inserts consistent, slugs unique, and password hashed

🏁 Signup Modal Workflow is now complete, secure, and production-ready.
