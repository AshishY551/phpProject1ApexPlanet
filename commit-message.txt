✅ FINAL STATUS:
- Login system is now **fully functional**
- Production-grade integration across frontend and backend
- Tested thoroughly (correct/wrong input, network errors, session write, UI states)

✅ Finalize & debug login system – fully functional & integrated

🔐 Login System is now 100% working across UI, JS, and backend:

1️⃣ Fixed: ❌ 'Network error - 🔐LOGIN' caused by improper route or malformed JSON
   - Validated POST request flow to /modules/users/login.php
   - Ensured correct Content-Type and JSON encoding in server response

2️⃣ Resolved: ❌ Incorrect credentials now handled gracefully
   - Used secure password verification (`password_verify`)
   - Shows proper error message on failure

3️⃣ ✅ Toast notifications added:
   - Visual feedback for both success and error
   - Uses reusable `showToast()` function
   - Clean styling and smooth visibility animation

4️⃣ 🔁 Prevented duplicate login requests:
   - Added `dataset.listenerAttached = "true"` before adding event listener
   - Avoids double fetch calls if JS loads more than once

5️⃣ 🎯 Login flow:
   - Correct credentials → toast → redirect to `/views/dashboard.php`
   - Incorrect credentials → error toast
   - Button feedback: “Signing in...” → “🚀 Sign In”

6️⃣ 👁️ Password field visibility toggle (👁️/🙈)
   - Improves user experience
   - Works across both dark and light themes

7️⃣ 🧠 Auth JS enhancements:
   - All logic scoped inside `DOMContentLoaded`
   - Signup and Login logic clearly separated
   - Modular and reusable for both full-page & modal

8️⃣ ✅ UI:
   - Responsive Tailwind login page (`views/auth/login.php`)
   - OAuth button placeholders added
   - Toast element included at bottom-right

9️⃣ 🔐 Security:
   - Backend sanitizes email and password
   - Only accepts POST requests
   - On success: stores user session (id, email, role, slug, etc.)

✅ FINAL STATUS:
- Login system is now **fully functional**
- Production-grade integration across frontend and backend
- Tested thoroughly (correct/wrong input, network errors, session write, UI states)
