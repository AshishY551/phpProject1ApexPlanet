✨ Add Modal-based Login & Signup Components (Reusable & Responsive)

- Added `sections/modals/signup-modal.php`: 
  ✅ Full-featured signup form wrapped in a responsive modal
  ✅ Matches full page version (fields, validation-ready)
  ✅ Includes modal-switch to login
  ✅ Designed for Tailwind + Dark Mode

- Added `sections/modals/login-modal.php`: 
  ✅ Full-featured login form in modal
  ✅ OAuth provider icons included
  ✅ Password toggle ready
  ✅ Switches to signup modal if needed

- Modal design follows industry UI patterns:
  ✅ Responsive on all screens
  ✅ Reusable across any page
  ✅ Tailwind-based with dark mode and animation support

- Prepared for future integrations:
  🔐 2FA (Two Factor Auth)
  🔁 AJAX submission via auth.js
  ☁️ OAuth flow expansion
  🔧 Toggle function to open/close (`toggleModal(id)`)

🔧 Next Step: Include these in `layout.php` or specific views,
     and wire them into `auth.js` for modal-based login/signup UX.
