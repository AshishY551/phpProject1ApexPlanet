✨🔐 Signup Modal Flow Fully Integrated with Debug

✅ Modal-based Signup UI (signup-modal.php):
- Built responsive, user-friendly modal using Tailwind CSS
- Styled fields, transitions, and modal layout
- Switch-to-login link with toggleModal()

✅ Auth Notice (auth-notice.php + auth-notice.js):
- Displays signup/login modal as notification prompt
- Uses sessionStorage to show only once per session
- Dismissible banner with interactive button

✅ Backend Logic (register.php):
- Sanitization and validation of fields (username, email, password)
- Checks for:
  - Empty/short username
  - Invalid email
  - Password mismatch / length
- Unique checks:
  - Email already exists ✅
  - Username already exists ✅
- Slug generation using helper function
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Secure database insert using PDO (prepared statements)
- JSON response for AJAX handling
- Structured error messages and try-catch for server fallback

✅ JS Integration (auth.js / auth-notice.js):
- Handles both full-page (`signupForm`) and modal (`signupFormModal`) AJAX submits
- Show success/error via toast (green/red)
- Auto-reset form on success
- Auto-close modal after delay
- Redirect to login page (planned)
- Prevents default behavior to avoid full page reload
- Console debugging added to trace issues
- Modular submit handler (`handleAuthForm`) for reuse

🐞 Debugging Issues Fixed:
- Fixed missing toast visibility behind modal
- Fixed `auth.js` not being loaded in some views
- Investigated network-level errors and DB ID gaps
- Traced cause of duplicate insert attempts (double binding)
- Added guard to prevent race condition double-submits (if needed)

⚠️ Known Remaining:
- Signup modal triggers duplicate insert when JS bindings conflict
- Toast may sometimes still be obscured on quick modal open
- Possible ID skip in DB due to failed second insert (expected in auto-increment)

🎯 Next Step:
- Finalize modal login logic
- Integrate session, redirect, and logout system
