✅ Debug: Signup Modal Flow Fixed — Toasts, Validation, Duplicate Handling

🔧 Fixed:
- Toast notifications now displaying correctly by isolating auth.js logic
- Resolved JS interference between full-page and modal signups

✅ Signup Modal Working:
- AJAX-enabled signup (no reload)
- Modal opens on page load with dismiss option
- Fully functional signup flow from UI to DB

🛡️ Validation:
- Duplicate email and username checks before insert
- Error messages shown inline via toast
- Green success toast on successful registration
- Form reset after success

🐞 Issue:
- Previously toast was hidden due to overlapping scripts
- Caused false 'Network Error' despite DB insert

🎯 Auth UX Now Stable. Ready for further te testing.
