feat: Implemented scroll-triggered fade-in animation using IntersectionObserver

- Added scroll-fade.js to /public/assets/js/components/ for lightweight viewport animation
- Applies animated entry effects to elements with .animate-enhanced-fade-in class
- Utilized GPU-optimized transitions: opacity, translateY, and scale for smooth experience
- Ensures performance and scalability using IntersectionObserver (no jQuery)
- Linked script in layout.php for global usage across components
