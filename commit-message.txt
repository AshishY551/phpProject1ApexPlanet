feat(ui): Enhanced fade-in animation for post grid components

- Replaced basic fade-in with advanced keyframe animation (enhanced-fade-in)
- Animation now includes smooth scale, subtle rotation, and blur effects
- Added `animate-enhanced-fade-in` utility class for reusable animated entry
- Ensures better visual feedback across cards, comments, and news blocks
- Fully responsive, GPU-optimized (`will-change`) and scalable for large UIs
- Stored CSS in /public/assets/css/components/animations.css for modular usage

Future-ready for integration with Intersection Observer or scroll triggers
