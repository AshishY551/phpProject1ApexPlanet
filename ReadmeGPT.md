When it comes to writing prompts for AI language models, there are some general rules that can help ensure that your prompts are effective and produce the desired results.

Select each section to carefully review some of the do's of prompt writing.

Be clear and specific

-

Use correct grammar and spelling

-

Keep it concise

-

Be polite and respectful

-

Use an appropriate format
–
Use the correct format for the prompt depending on what you want the AI language model to do.

For example, if you want ChatGPT to generate text, use a text generation prompt. An example of a good prompt for text generation depends on the specific task you want the model to perform. Here are a few examples:

For a summarization task: "Please summarize this news article in one or two sentences."
For a creative writing task: "Write a short story about a person who discovers a hidden world."
For a dialogue generation task: "Write a conversation between two people discussing their favorite hobbies."
For a translation task: "Please translate this sentence from English to Spanish: 'The cat is sleeping on the couch.'"
For a question-answering task: "What is the capital of France?"
Select each section to carefully review some of the dont's of prompt writing.

Don't use vague language
–
Avoid using vague or ambiguous language that can be interpreted in different ways. Be specific and clear about what you want the AI language model to do.

For example, this prompt–"Write a story about a man who caught a fish."–is vague because it does not provide specific details about the story's setting, plot, or characters. As a result, there are many ways to interpret the prompt and write a story based on it.

Don't use slang or jargon
–
AI language models might not be familiar with slang or jargon, so it's best to avoid using these types of terms in your prompts.

Don't over-complicate the task
–
Keep the task simple and straightforward. Avoid asking for too much or making the task overly complex, as this can lead to inaccurate or incomplete results.

Don't be too broad
–
Avoid writing prompts that are too broad or general. This can make it difficult for the AI language model to understand what you're asking for and lead to poor results.

For example, this prompt–"Write an essay about technology."–doesn't provide any specific focus or direction for the essay. The term "technology" is very general and can encompass a wide range of topics. Without a more specific focus, the AI language model might struggle to generate a cohesive and well-supported essay on the topic of technology. The resulting essay could end up being too general or unfocused, or it might not address the specific aspects of technology that the user was hoping to explore.

Another good rule to follow is to always proofread your prompts before submitting them to an AI language model. Errors in spelling or grammar can lead to inaccurate results, so it's important to make sure your prompts are free of errors.

You can conclude it helps to carefully and correctly craft your prompts as you build the conversation.

# With AI language models, you can request whatever you want and then refine your prompts based on the responses provided. Basically, you can have a question-answer conversation with an AI language model. In fact, the activities in this course were partially created by asking ChatGPT for advice about how to create them and they started with prompts!

I need an itinerary for a Paris vacation.
I'd like to visit some museums and attend a couple of popular shows at night.
And I need you to include a hotel in a central location.
I'd like to stay at the same hotel both nights, and the cost should be about $200 per night.

ChatGPT selected a single hotel within the price requested and added it to the itinerary.

Replace the Louvre with a couple of activities good for an unmarried 25-year-old person.

Note: If the itinerary generated by ChatGPT for you doesn't include the Louvre, simply replace something else in your itinerary.
For day 3, recommend some shops where I can buy souvenirs under $50 each for my family. My mother likes to cook, and my brother enjoys football.
I like these options. Add these shops to the 3-day itinerary.

XXXXXXXXXXXX dont do long chat-

-Remember, generative AI models are iterative, meaning that they will produce an original response every time based on the data that it draws from. Therefore, the answers that ChatGPT provides here will likely differ from what it generates for you
